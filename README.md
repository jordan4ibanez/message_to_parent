# message_to_parent
 A simple library for child structs to talk to and interact with their parents without violating the borrow checker. 

This is a hyperactive alternative to message passing and verbose returns.

Please see the [/examples/ folder](https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/message_to_parent/tree/master/examples) for a tutorial on how to use this!
